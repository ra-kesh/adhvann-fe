Each course has its benefits and is suitable for a certain career path. This article is designed to help people like you choose the best finance education option. We will discuss these two certifications in detail.

                    <h5>CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst)</h5>
                    <p>
                        This is a specialized professional course offered by the CFA Institute internationally to train graduates in the field of investment and finance. This course is recognized worldwide as a really in depth and valuable certification for a person. It teaches you about a broad range of topics relating to investment and portfolio management, financial analysis, stocks, bonds, and derivatives, and provides a generalist knowledge of other areas of finance. There are three CFA Program exams (Level I, Level II, and Level III).

                    <h5>To become a CFA charterholder, you need to:</h5>
                    <p>
                        1. Have a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) or be in the final year of your bachelor’s degree program. If you have 4,000 hours of relevant work experience or a combination of professional work and university experience that totals 4,000 hours, you are also eligible to start the CFA Program.
                        2. Take and pass the Level I, Level II, and Level III CFA Program exams.
                        3. Become a member of CFA Institute (which costs $275 and includes agreeing to abide by its code of ethics).
                        4. Provide CFA Institute with proof that you’ve been working full-time for 4000 hours in a role that either involves investment decision-making or with a product that contributes to that process. This can include any work experience you had before passing the exam, as well as after.
                        The topics of the CFA Program exams are:
                        1. Ethical and professional standards
                        2. Quantitative methods
                        3. Economics
                        4. Financial reporting and analysis
                        5. Corporate finance
                        6. Equity investments
                        7. Fixed income

CFA exam fees range from $700 to $1,450, depending on your CFA exam level and whether you register early, during the standard registration period, or late.

                    <h5>FRM (Financial Risk Management)</h5>
                    <p>
                        FRM certification is a much more specific course than the CFA charter. Its focus is managing exposure to operational credit, markets, foreign exchange, volatility, liquidity, inflation, business, legal, reputational, and sector risk. The CFA charter requires knowledge and expertise in a much broader range of financial analysis topics, such as portfolio management, economics, reporting, quantitative analysis, and more. Another difference is exam structure. There are two FRM exams (Part I and Part II).

                    </p>
                    <h5>To earn your FRM certificate, you need to:
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        1. Take and pass the FRM exams. There are no degree or work requirements for taking the exams.
                        2. Work full-time in a financial risk role for 2 years.
                        3. Demonstrate your experience to GARP by describing your professional role in financial risk management and submitting it to GARP within 5 years of passing Part II.
                        The topics for the FRM exams are :-
                        1. Foundations of risk management
                        2. Quantitative analysis
                        3. Financial markets and products
                        4. Valuation and risk models
                        5. Market risk measurement and management
                        6. Credit risk measurement and management
                        7. Operational risk and resiliency
                        8. Liquidity and treasury risk measurement and management
                        9. Risk management and investment management
                        10. Current issues in financial markets

                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Choosing Which Course to pursue?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Choosing which designation to pursue depends on what you hope to achieve from these courses as a person interested in the financial sector. FRM’s mostly hold managerial positions that focus on risk and investment risk. These jobs may be credit risk manager, market risk manager, regulatory risk manager, or operational risk manager. So if you’re interested in these job titles then pursuing a FRM course might be the best option for you. If you’re interested in becoming a portfolio manager, research analyst, consultant, risk manager, corporate financial analyst, financial adviser, or moving into the C-suite, then the CFA charter will be a better fit.
                        Of course its not a this or that question, you can choose to do both these courses as both can work together and help you in understanding risk and investments as both these go hand in hand. No matter which path you choose, there is a wealth of information out there that can help you earn the credential or credentials you need.
